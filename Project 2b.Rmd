Introduction:
https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2024/2024-09-24/country_results_df.csv
The Country Results Dataset contains team and individual performance data from various countries participating in competitions. It includes:

Team size (all, male, female) and participant scores (p1 to p7).
Award counts: Gold, silver, bronze, and honorable mentions.
Leaders and deputy leaders for each countryâ€™s team.


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

# Step 1: Load the Dataset
country_data <- read.csv("/Users/aribarazzaq/Desktop/country_results_df.csv")

# Inspect the structure and first few rows
str(country_data)
head(country_data)

# Step 2: Tidy the Data
# Pivot participant scores (p1 to p7) from wide to long format
country_long <- country_data %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("p"),  # Pivot all p1 to p7 columns
    names_to = "participant", 
    values_to = "score"
  )

# Preview the tidied data
head(country_long)

# Step 3: Data Transformation and Analysis

## 3.1: Calculate the average participant score per country
average_scores <- country_long %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(avg_score = mean(score, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_score))

# View the average scores
print(average_scores)

## 3.2: Summarize total awards by country
awards_summary <- country_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(
    total_gold = sum(awards_gold, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_silver = sum(awards_silver, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_bronze = sum(awards_bronze, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_honorable_mentions = sum(awards_honorable_mentions, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# View the awards summary
print(awards_summary)

# Step 4: Visualization - Average Participant Scores by Country

# Filter the top 20 countries by average score and wrap long names
top_countries <- average_scores %>%
  slice_head(n = 20) %>%
  mutate(country = str_wrap(country, width = 15))  # Wrap long names for readability

# Create a polished plot for top 20 countries by average score
ggplot(top_countries, aes(x = reorder(country, avg_score), y = avg_score, fill = avg_score)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +  # Adjust base font size for readability
  coord_flip() +  # Horizontal bars for better fit
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "lightblue", high = "darkblue") +  # Color gradient
  labs(
    title = "Top 20 Countries by Average Participant Score",
    x = "Country", y = "Average Score"
  ) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),  # Adjust y-axis text size
    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),  # Adjust x-axis text size
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 18, face = "bold"),  # Centered, bold title
    legend.position = "none"  # Remove legend for simplicity
  )


```


Data Tidying:

Used pivot_longer() to reshape participant scores into long format.
Data Transformation:

Calculated average participant scores per country.
Summarized total awards (gold, silver, bronze, honorable mentions) per country.
Visualization:

Created a horizontal bar plot with the top 20 countries by average score.
Used color gradients to improve visual appeal and wrapped long country names for better readability.
