##Introduction:
The data set offers predictions of soccer match outcomes based on FiveThirtyEightâ€™s Soccer Power Index (SPI). This index is used to rate teams' offensive and defensive capabilities, which are then combined to generate win probabilities and expected scores for upcoming matches.

spi_matches.csv contains match-by-match SPI ratings and forecasts back to 2016.
Article link: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-predictions/
 
I have selected meaningful columns, including match date, team names, Soccer Power Index (SPI) for both teams, and their respective win probabilities.
Columns were renamed to make them more intuitive.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}

spi_matches <- read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/soccer-api/club/spi_matches.csv")
# Select a subset of the columns (Date, Team 1, Team 2, Team 1 SPI, Team 2 SPI, Win Probabilities)
spi_matches_subset <- dplyr::select(spi_matches, date, team1, team2, spi1, spi2, prob1, prob2, probtie)

# Rename columns for better clarity, explicitly calling dplyr's rename function
spi_matches_subset <- dplyr::rename(spi_matches_subset,
    Date = date,
    Team_1 = team1,
    Team_2 = team2,
    Team_1_SPI = spi1,
    Team_2_SPI = spi2,
    Team_1_Win_Prob = prob1,
    Team_2_Win_Prob = prob2,
    Tie_Prob = probtie
)

# Display first few rows of the cleaned dataset
head(spi_matches_subset)

```


##Conculusion: 
We can use this dataset in future by implementing machine learning techniques to understand how SPI corelate with actual match outcome.
